/*
    Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id
    of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount,
    return the smallest of their ids.

    Use the Scanner for input format:
    - The first line contains an integer, n, the size of array.
    - The second line describes arr as n space-separated integers, each a type number of the bird sighted.

    Input example:
    11
    1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 3 4

    Output example: 3

    Explanation:
    It is guaranteed that each type is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:
    - Type 1: 2 bird
    - Type 2: 2 birds
    - Type 3: 3 birds
    - Type 4: 3 birds
    - Type 5: 1 birds
    Two types have a frequency of 3, and the lowest of those is type 3.
